What is git?

"Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

Version Control: Tracks changes made to files, enabling rollback to previous versions if needed.
Distributed System: Every developer has a local copy of the entire codebase, including its full history.
Branching and Merging: Allows creation of branches for new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Changes can be merged back into the main branch.
Commit and Push: Saves changes locally (commit) and then sends them to a central repository (push)."
